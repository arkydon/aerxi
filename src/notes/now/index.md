> This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) - inspired by Derek Sivers' movement to share what we're currently focused on.

**‚è≥ Currently**

- Watching Dota streams.
- Horror movie binge.
- Wandering through Google Street View spots around the world. (exploring on natural environments)
- Javascript.
- Slowly updating my website.

**üìå Planning**

- Making another Pokemon rom hack.
- Building a reading habit with ebooks

**‚úîÔ∏è Done**

- Remade my website using [lume](https://lume.land)
- Upgraded to SSD + Windows 11 for better performance
- Switching to Microsoft Edge + uBo lite on Android. Kiwi hadn't been updated in a long time and Edge supports extentions now.
- ~Switching and migrating all my notes from Notion to Upnote. Notion was becoming too slow and laggy.~

**‚è∏Ô∏è Paused**

- Playing Pokemon Black Pearl Emerald.
- Playing Dota games.
- Tweaking my website design.
