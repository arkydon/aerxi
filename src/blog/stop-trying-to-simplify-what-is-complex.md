Maybe that thing bothering you and disrupting your peace, the thing you can’t accept or understand, is something **complex** that you keep trying to simplify in your head. It doesn’t fit into any typical box or cookie-cutter mold. You keep trying and failing to simplify it, and that makes you frustrated.

Maybe not everything in life is simple. 

Maybe it can't be simplified because there are multiple aspects that make it what it is.Just let it be and stop trying to strip out all the things that make it what it is.

Maybe it can’t be simplified because everything that seems similar isn’t actually the same. You're comparing it to something else and expecting it to look and behave the same way. Open your mind, not everything needs to fit into your brain’s cookie-cutter molds.
